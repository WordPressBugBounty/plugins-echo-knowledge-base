## üöÄ AI Chat - Turn Your Knowledge Base into a 24/7 Support Pro

Transform your knowledge base into an intelligent assistant that provides instant, accurate answers to user questions.

**AI Chat** can answer questions by drawing on content from your Knowledge Base, FAQs, internal documentation, notes, pages, or any other information source you choose.

**73% fewer repeat tickets (our own numbers)** ‚Äì After enabling AI Chat, we saw a 73% drop in repetitive questions. Response times shrank, customers got answers faster, and the team could finally tackle higher-value projects *without* hiring extra staff.

### Why Customers Love It

* **Answers in Seconds, Day or Night** ‚Äì The bot reads your KB articles, FAQs, pages, and internal notes, then delivers clear replies *before* a ticket ever lands in your inbox.
* **Set-Up in a Coffee Break** ‚Äì A guided wizard takes you from install to "live" in under 30 minutes. No coding, no external APIs, no fuss.
* **Visible ROI, Fast** ‚Äì Most teams cut repeat questions within the first week, freeing staff for revenue-generating work instead of copy-paste responses.


### AI-Powered Search Integration

Not only does Echo Knowledge Base offer an interactive chatbot, it also **supercharges your site‚Äôs search**. When users perform a search, they‚Äôll see the usual article results *alongside* an option to **‚ÄúAsk AI‚Äù** the same question. This means visitors can get immediate, concise answers from your content ‚Äì without ever leaving the search page. It‚Äôs like giving your search bar the power of a support agent, helping users find what they need faster than ever.

**Result:** fewer repetitive support tickets and unanswered questions, happier users, and a support team free to focus on high-value work that moves your business forward.
